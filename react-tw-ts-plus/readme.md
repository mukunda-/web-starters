## react-tw-ts-plus

Starter files for a modern webapp with Tailwind CSS (via PostCSS), Sass (optional),
Typescript, and React. Packaged with Webpack.

### Running

Includes example Express server. Default host is localhost on port 80.

`npm run dev` to build and serve. _Concurrently_ is used to run both the build and server
processes.

`npm run build` to build production files.

### Formatting

`npm run format` to execute prettier.

I recommend the `esbenp.prettier-vscode` VS Code extension for format-on-save.

### Testing

Includes react-testing-library and jsdom configuration.

`npm run test`
